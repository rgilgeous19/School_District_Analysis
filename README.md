# SCHOOL DISTRICT ANALYSIS

## Overview of Project

  The purpose of this analysis is to prepare an standardized test data analysis and
  report to provide insights about performance trends and patterns, in order to 
  help the School Board make strategic decisions from a district and school level. They 
  will be able to make more insightful decisions regarding budgets and priorities. There 
  was evidence of academic dishonesty, so this challenge replaces the math and reading scores
  to analyze any changes to the School District Analysis.
